Based on the previous results, I agree with Louise to play instead of journalism, publishing, etc., because the graphic bar tell us that outcomes´s playing has more than 50% of successfulness. But according to the outcomes based on Launch Date, I recommend Louise to start the campaign in the second trimester of the year, specifically on May, this is because we can see a tendency of succesfulness, otherwise, we can see in both, first and last trimester a tendency of failure. Finally, I recoomend Louise to estimate a fund no more than $2,000.00, because according to the statistical graphic, all the play´s campaigns pledged less than $2,000.00, having a goal of $4,000.00. This mean that the play´s campaigns pledged a half of their fund goal.
